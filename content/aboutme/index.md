## Some Background Information

I am **Sumit Alam Khan** (aka lolipop üç≠), a Crypto player from team [IUT GENESIS](https://ctftime.org/team/175924), Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh. I have been studying Computer Science and Engineering at Islamic University of Technology since **January 2020**.

Started playing CTFs regularly since **June 2021**. When I'm not playing with my university team, 
I play solo with the most random team names possible. (**Update: As I've graduated, I'm looking for a new team to play with.**)

Also a competitive programmer(**used to be** actually). My coding profiles are [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/sad_panda), [codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/sumitalamkhan), [atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/iloveSNP).

Was an intern at [Tree plus plus](http://treepp.org), I am also looking forward to learning more about **Blockchain** in the future.

I want to pursue a career in cryptographic research in the future(even though I am terrible at math üò´).

I have graduated University on June 28th 2024. And currently joined as a lecturer at a private university(BUBT). 

Currently looking for PhD opportunities abroad related to Cryptography. Preferebly zero-knowledge proofs or Homomorphic Encryption.
