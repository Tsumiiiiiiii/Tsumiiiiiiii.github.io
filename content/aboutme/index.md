## Some Background Information

I am **Sumit Alam Khan** (aka lolipop 🍭), a Crypto player from team [IUT GENESIS](https://ctftime.org/team/175924), Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh. I have been studying Computer Science and Engineering at Islamic University of Technology since **January 2020**.

Started playing CTFs regularly since **June 2021**. When I'm not playing with my university team, 
I play solo with the most random team names possible. (**Update: I have been recruited by the well known international team called [DeadSec](https://ctftime.org/team/19339/).**)

Also a competitive programmer(**used to be** actually).

I have graduated University on June 28th 2024. And currently joined as a lecturer at a private university(BUBT). 

Was an intern at [Tree plus plus](http://treepp.org). 

I want to pursue a career in cryptographic research in the future(even though I am terrible at math 😫). Currently looking for PhD opportunities abroad related to Cryptography. Preferebly zero-knowledge proofs or Homomorphic Encryption.
