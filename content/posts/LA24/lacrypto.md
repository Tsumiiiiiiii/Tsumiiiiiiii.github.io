Writeup for some Cryptography challenges from LA CTF 24.


# prove it!

From the name and the description we get the hint that this problem is about zk-snarks. Though we can solve this problem without even knowing what zero-knowledge proof is. This is the script that we are provided with:

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/python
import random

flag = "lactf{??????????}"
p = 171687271187362402858253153317226779412519708415758861260173615154794651529095285554559087769129718750696204276854381696836947720354758929262422945910586370154930700427498878225153794722572909742395687687136063410003254320613429926120729809300639276228416026933793038009939497928563523775713932771366072739767


if __name__ == "__main__":
    
	s = random.getrandbits(128)
	alpha = random.getrandbits(40)
	g = redacted
	ss = [pow(g, s**i, p) for i in range(1,8)]
	alphas = [pow(g, alpha * s**i, p) for i in range(1,8)]
	print(f"Use these values to evaluate your polynomials on s")
	print(f"Powers of s: {ss}")
	print(f"Powers of alpha*s: {alphas}")
	tries = 0
	while True:
		if tries >= 2:
			print("Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me")
			break
		print("Can you prove to me you know the polynomial f that im thinking of?")
		target = []
		for i in range(8):
			target.append(random.randrange(p))
		print(f"Coefficients of target polynomial: {target}")
		ts = sum([(pow(s,7 - i, p) * target[i]) % p for i in range(len(target))]) % p
		f = int(input("give me your evaluation of f(s) > ")) % p
		h = int(input("give me your evaluation of h(s) > ")) % p
		fa = int(input("give me your evaluation of f(alpha * s) > ")) % p
		if f <= 1 or h <= 1 or fa <=1 or f == p-1 or h == p-1 or fa == p-1:
			print("nope")
			exit()
			
		if pow(f, alpha, p) != fa or f != pow(h, ts, p):
			print(f"failed! The target was {ts}")
			tries += 1
			continue
	
		print(f"you made it! here you got {flag}")
		break
```

The program flow is as follows:

1. A prime $p$ is given which is always fixed.
2. $s$ is a $128 \ bit$ variable and $\alpha$ is a $40 \ bit$ variable generated randomly and kept secret. $g$ is also a secret but always fixed.
3. Two public arrays are generated. $ss = g^{s^1}, g^{s^2}, \cdots, g^{s^8} \mod p$ and $alphas = g^{\alpha \dot \ s^1}, g^{\alpha \dot \ s^2}, \cdots, g^{\alpha \dot \ s^8} \mod p$.
4. Then we are given two rounds where for each round, 
   1. A public array $target$ of length 8 is randomly generated where each value is within the range of $p$. 
   2. A private value $ts$ is calculated as $ts=\sum_{i=0}^7 s^{7-i} \cdot target_i \mod p$. 
   3. We have to provide the value for 3 variables $f, fa, h$ such that $f^{\alpha} \equiv fa \mod p$ and $h^{ts} \equiv f \mod p$. To stop cheesing, there are some further restrictions on the values: they must be in the range $[2, p-2]$ inclusive. 
   4. If we lose the round, the private value $ts$ is revealed. If we win, the flag is revealed.

My solution comprised of two steps:
1. Recover $\alpha$ using `discrete log`.
2. Recover $s$ using the polynomial modular equation solver of `sage-math`.

### Recover $\alpha$

As I have already spoiled, we are going to apply `dlog` for this step. But we don't even know $g$. What do we do now? Let, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
b' &\equiv \frac{ss_2}{ss_1} &\equiv \frac{g^{s^2}}{g^s} &\equiv g^{s^2 - s} & \mod p \\\
b'' &\equiv \frac{alphas_2}{alphas_1} &\equiv \frac{g^{\alpha \cdot s^2}}{g^{\alpha \dot \ s}} &\equiv g^{\alpha \dot \ (s^2 - s)} & \mod p \\\
\rightarrow b'' & \equiv(b')^{\alpha} &&& \mod p
\end{aligned}
$$

Since we know both $b''$ and $b'$,  $g$ becomes irrelevant.  We can shift our focus solely on solving the `dlog` $b'' \equiv (b')^{\alpha}$ now. But $p$ is a $1024 \ bit$ prime. Maybe the group order is smooth? Upon checking on `factor-db`, we get a very interesting insight

$$
p - 1 = ¬†2 √ó \underbrace{7 √ó 13 √ó 19 √ó 53 √ó 1777 √ó 13873}\_{42 \ bits} √ó 375066 324492 304430 531233¬†√ó 101 \cdots 063
$$

$\alpha$ is $40 \ bits$. Hurray üòÇ, we do have a sub-group small enough to solve the `dlog` efficiently. The largest prime there ($12873$) is just $14 \ bits$.  We don't even need `baby-steps-giant-steps`,  literally brute forcing would suffice for each prime. Finally we can combine each `log` using `crt` and recover the original $\alpha$. 

```python
F = GF(p)

def discrete_log(y, g, f):
    for pw in range(f):
        y_ = pow(g, pw, f)
        if y == y_:
            return pw
    return -1

values = []
mods = []
for f in fs:
    o = (p-1) // f
    Pg = F(b_)^o
    Py = F(b__)^o
    r = discrete_log(Py, Pg, f)
    if r > -1: 
        mods.append(f)
        values.append(r)
    
print('found', crt(values, mods))
```

{{< admonition type=warning title="Be aware" open=true >}} 
Sometimes the b'' itself might lie in the subgroup of the smaller primes. We can't do `dlog` in that case. That is why we can try using all the $ss_i, alphas_i$ pairs, or keep running the instance until a suitable $ss_0, alphas_0$ pair appears.
{{< /admonition >}}

### Recover $s$

The plan is to *sacrifice* the first round so that we can get $ts$. $s$ is **fixed** for both rounds, which means if we manage to recover $s$ now, we can win the second round.

$$ts=s^7 \cdot target_0 + s^6 \cdot target_1 + \cdots + s^0 \cdot target_7 \mod p$$ 
No big brain üß† move is necessary here. Just use `sage-math` and profit !!

```python
P.<x> = PolynomialRing(Zmod(p))
f = sum(x^(7-i)*target[i] for i in range(8))
f -= ts
f = f.monic()
f.roots()
```

### Recover $flag$

Since we know both $\alpha$ and $s$ now, on the second round we can send  $f^{\alpha} \equiv fa \mod p$ and $h^{ts} \equiv f \mod p$ and $h=5$ to successfully retrieve the flag.

# shuffle

My favorite problem of the year so far. The idea is simple but elegant. Thanks to the author ‚ù§. This is the script we are given:

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/python3

from secrets import randbits
import math
from base64 import b64encode
MESSAGE_LENGTH = 617

class LCG:

    def __init__(self,a,c,m,seed):
        self.a = a
        self.c = c
        self.m = m
        self.state = seed

    def next(self):
        self.state = (self.a * self.state + self.c) % self.m
        return self.state

def generate_random_quad():
    return randbits(64),randbits(64),randbits(64),randbits(64)

initial_iters = randbits(16)

def encrypt_msg(msg, params):
    global initial_iters
    a, c, m, seed = params
    L = LCG(a, c, m, seed)
    for i in range(initial_iters):
        L.next()
    l = len(msg)
    permutation = []
    chosen_nums = set()
    while len(permutation) < l:
        pos = L.next() % l
        if pos not in chosen_nums:
            permutation.append(pos)
            chosen_nums.add(pos)
    output = ''.join([msg[i] for i in permutation])
    return output

# period is necessary
secret = b64encode(open('secret_message.txt','rb').read().strip()).decode() + '.'
length = len(secret)
assert(length == MESSAGE_LENGTH)

a, c, m, seed = params = generate_random_quad()
enc_secret = encrypt_msg(secret,params)

while True:
    choice = input("What do you want to do?\n1: Shuffle a message.\n2: Get the encrypted secret.\n3: Quit.\n> ")
    if choice == "1":
        message = input("Ok. What do you have to say?\n")
        if (len(message) >= length):
            print("I ain't reading allat.\n")
        elif (math.gcd(len(message),m) != 1):
            print("Are you trying to hack me?\n")
        else:
            print(f"Here you go: {encrypt_msg(message,params)}\n")
    elif choice == "2":
        print(f"Here you go: {enc_secret}\n")
    elif choice == "3":
        print("bye bye")
        exit(0)
    else:
        print("Bad choice.\n")
```


The outer program flow is easy to understand. Let us try to see what happens in the `encrypt_msg` function. 

1. An object called `LCG` is generated with fixed params `a, c, m, seed`.
2. The `LCG` state is progressed a fixed amount of times (`initial_iter` times to be exact).
3. The next states are used to encrypt the message.
4. The encryption here is simply a *permutation* operation. `pos = L.next() % l` and in this way, the entire message is shuffled and returned. 
5. There is a *catch*. If there is a repetition of `pos`, then that value is discarded and the next state is evaluated. 

## Understanding `LCG`

`Linear Congruential Generator` or `LCG` denotes a linear function used for generating random numbers. It can be denoted with a recursive function as follows:

$$X_{n+1} = a \cdot X_n + c \mod m$$

Here, 

* `a` is the multiplier
* `c` is the increment
* `m` is the modulo which is generally a prime
* $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n$ are the states, with $X_0$ being the initial state or the `seed`

Suppose we don't know $a, c, m, seed$ (which is the case for the given problem as well) but we somehow managed to get our hands on 6 consecutive states of the `LCG` ($X_n, X_{n+1}, \cdots, X_{n+5}$), we have a process to recover $a, c, m$ from them.

### Recover the modulo `m`

Suppose we know the states $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_6$. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
X_1 &\equiv a \cdot X_0 + c &\mod m \\\ 
X_2 &\equiv a \cdot X_1 + c &\mod m \\\ 
\vdots \\\
X_6 &\equiv a \cdot X_5 + c &\mod m \\\ 
\end{aligned}
$$

For each consecutive pair of equations, we can subtract the first from the second to get

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_0 \rightarrow X_2 - X_1 & \equiv a \cdot (X_1 - X_0) &\mod m \\\
T_1 \rightarrow X_3 - X_2 & \equiv a \cdot (X_2 - X_1) &\mod m \\\
T_2 \rightarrow X_4 - X_3 & \equiv a \cdot (X_3 - X_2) &\mod m \\\
T_3 \rightarrow X_5 - X_4 & \equiv a \cdot (X_4 - X_3) &\mod m \\\
T_4 \rightarrow X_6 - X_5 & \equiv a \cdot (X_5 - X_4) &\mod m
\end{aligned}
$$

We can divide each consecutive pair of $T$ to cut off the $a$ term.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{T_1}{T_2} &\equiv \frac{X_3 - X_2}{X_4 - X3} \equiv \frac{X_2 - X_1}{X_3 - X_2} &\mod m \\\
\rightarrow \frac{T_1}{T_2} &\equiv \frac{X_2 - X_1}{X_3 - X_2} &\mod m \\\
\rightarrow \frac{T_1}{T_2} &\equiv \frac{T_0}{T_1} &\mod m \\\
\rightarrow T_1 ^ 2 &\equiv T_0 \cdot T_2 &\mod m \\\
\rightarrow T1^2 - T_0 \cdot T_2 &= k_1 \cdot m
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, we can write

$$
\begin{aligned}
T2^2 - T_1  \cdot T_3 &= k_2 \cdot m \\\
T3^2 - T_2  \cdot T_4 &= k_3 \cdot m
\end{aligned}
$$

If we take the `gcd` of these 3 terms, what we get is

$$GCD(k_1 \cdot m, k_2 \cdot m, k_3 \cdot m) = m $$

 It might be the case that $k_1, k_2, k_3$ shares a common factor then we will be getting a multiple of $m$. But even if that is the case, the multiple is going to be so *small* that we can do some trial division and eliminate that multiple.

### Recover the multiple `a` and the increment `c`

Since we do know $m$ now, it becomes trivial to recover $a$ and $c$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
a &\equiv \frac{X_3 - X_2}{X_2 - X_1} &\mod m \\\
c &\equiv X_2 - a \cdot X_1 &\mod m
\end{aligned}
$$

We can use the below script(that I collected from another writeup last year) to crack the `LCG` parameters.

```python
from functools import reduce

def modinv(x, p):
    return pow(x, -1, p)

def crack_unknown_increment(states, modulus, multiplier):
    increment = (states[1] - states[0] * multiplier) % modulus
    return modulus, multiplier, increment

def crack_unknown_multiplier(states, modulus):
    multiplier = (states[2] - states[1]) * modinv(states[1] - states[0], modulus) % modulus
    return crack_unknown_increment(states, modulus, multiplier)


def crack_unknown_modulus(states):
    diffs = [s1 - s0 for s0, s1 in zip(states, states[1:])]
    zeroes = [t2 * t0 - t1 * t1 for t0, t1, t2 in zip(diffs, diffs[1:], diffs[2:])]
    modulus = abs(reduce(gcd, zeroes))
    return crack_unknown_multiplier(states, modulus)
```


## Tackling the given problem

We know how to crack `LCG` and we also know we have to recover 6 *consecutive* states of the `LCG` first. Suppose `initial iters` is $n$, so every time we query for a message $m$, the states $X_n, X_{n+1}, X_{n+2}, \cdots, X_{n + sz - 1}$ is used. Since we are concerned with 6 states only, we need $X_{n+1}, X_{n+2}, \cdots, X_{n+5}$ only. (For the time being, I am going to assume that no repetitions will occur and hence no state will be skipped). 

As test, we send `message = abcdefg`.

<kbd> <img src="https://github.com/Tsumiiiiiiii/Tsumiiiiiiii.github.io/blob/main/content/posts/LA24/shuffle.png?raw=true"
 style="border-radius:2%" align="center" width = "100%" /> </kbd>

From the last table, we can deduce the following equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
X_{n} &\equiv 5 &\mod 7 \\\
X_{n + 1} &\equiv 3 &\mod 7 \\\
X_{n + 2} &\equiv 6 &\mod 7 \\\
\vdots \\\
X_{n + 6} &\equiv 1 &\mod 7 \\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Not bad, we have a *tiny* portion of $X_n, \cdots, X_{n+5}$ ( i.e. $X_i \mod 7)$. As $X_i$ is a $64 \ bit$ number, we need $X_i \mod \ a \ 65 \ bit \ number$ to recover the original $X_i$. 

We can repeat the same process for $m = 7, 11, 13, 17, \cdots$ until the product of the $mods$ is big enough. Suppose we have this:

$$
\underbrace{X_n \mod (7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \cdots \cdot 67)}\_{CRT}
\begin{cases}
\begin{aligned}
X_{n} &\equiv 5 &\mod 7 \\\
X_{n} &\equiv 8 &\mod 11 \\\
X_{n} &\equiv 2 &\mod 13 \\\
\vdots \\\
X_{n} &\equiv 43 &\mod 67
\end{aligned}
\end{cases}
$$

In the same way, we can use `chinese-remainder-theorem` or `CRT` to recover $X_{n+1}, \cdots, X_{n+5}$ as well. 

As the characters in each message that we send must be unique and printable, we send characters from the ascii range $33$ to $127$. That is, for a message of length $k$, we send: $message_k = ascii_{33} + ascii_{33+1} + ascii_{33+2} + \cdots + ascii_{33 + k - 1}$. 

### But are all the states actually *consecutive* ?

Remember the assumption I made earlier? *For the time being, I am going to assume that no repetitions will occur and hence no state will be skipped*. This rarely holds. In *almost* all of the cases, there will be some states that will be skipped. And if that happens, the `LCG` solver will return some garbage value that will be easy to understand. I ran a simulation to check how frequent that is and printed `m, a, c`.

```shell
4 0 3
1 0 0
1 0 0
1 0 0
4 0 3
1 0 0
1 0 0
1 0 0
5 0 2
1 0 0
1 0 0
1 0 0
1 0 0
1 0 0
1 0 0

5817747651381476157 3630784695756569456 5646245808023284019
```

For all skip cases, it gave values that are impossible (very small values). But in the last line, we can see a *lucky* case where no state was skipped and we get a value that is large enough(around $64 \ bits)$.  On average, after every $15$ to $20$ runs, we get a *lucky* case like that. That is when we progress our solve and for other cases, we skip and move on to the next.
